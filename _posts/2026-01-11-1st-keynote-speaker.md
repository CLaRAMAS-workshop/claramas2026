Prof. Lorini's research mostly concerns the development of **formal models of interaction between cognitive agents**.
His work exploits **logic and game theory** as formal tools for building models of interaction between cognitive agents.
Recently, he authored paper *"[A rule-based modal view of causal reasoning](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2023/0366.pdf)"*, published at IJACI 2023, 
on a theme that is particularly relevant for the workshop.

📣 Stay tuned to get updates about our 2nd speaker, and the theme of their talks 😉
