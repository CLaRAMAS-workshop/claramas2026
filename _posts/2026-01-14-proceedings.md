Accepted papers (both full and short, not posters) will be published 
after a 2nd, **light review round** set up for the camera-ready version
to check that reviewers' suggestions have been reasonably incorporated,
and criticism satisfactorily addressed.

📢 Stay tuned 📢 for additional information regarding the expected timeline and workflow.
