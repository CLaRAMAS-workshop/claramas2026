#### Format

CLaRAMAS is a 1-day workshop, featuring the following activities: 
  * **2 invited talks** from leading experts in causal reasoning and engineering of agent systems 
(morning and afternoon) 
  * **oral presentations** for all the accepted full papers 
split in topic-based sessions spanning across both the morning and the afternoon, 
and each followed by a Q&A window 
  * **2 poster sessions** for papers accepted as extended abstracts (see the [publication](/submission) page), 
planned in a short break between each full papers session
  * a working activity with **focus groups** assembled during the day, depending on participants' interests
(scheduled dynamically, but most probably at the end of the afternoon session)

The focus groups have separate, "hands-on" brainstorming sessions 
meant to pinpoint the most promising research directions to be pursued within the AAMAS community, 
the most pressing challenges to be dealt with, 
and the open issues still needing clarification, 
with the aim of **collaboratively draft a white paper on causal learning and reasoning in agents and MAS**.
