#### Submission

Paper submission follows the **same instructions as the main track**, 
described [here](https://cyprusconferences.org/aamas2026/submission-instructions/). 
In particular: 
  * same format ([AAMAS LaTeX template](https://cyprusconferences.org/aamas2026/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AAMAS-2026-Formatting-Instructions-pre-CR.zip)) 
  * same length (8 pages excluding references)
  * same policy for supplementary material

The submission link is yet TBA, 📢 stay tuned 📢

#### Review process

Submitted papers will undergo a **double-blind review** process 
involving at least **3 reviewers** per paper. 

Papers will be evaluated upon 
  * **appropriateness** to the workshop's topics
  * **novelty** with respect to the state of the art
  * technical **soundness** of the contribution
  * expected **impact** on the practical engineering of agents and MAS
  * **reproducibility** of experiments (if any)
  * **clarity** of the exposition
 
Reviewers will have the chance to accept a paper as a **poster** 
instead of a full paper, *provided that the authors opted in* during submission. 

In that case, a shortened, **3-page** (excluding references) extended abstract version 
will be accepted as accompanying the poster. 

#### Publication of accepted papers

> 🔨 Under construction 🔨

We are negotiating publication of accepted papers and extended abstracts 
with Springer in a **LNCS/LNAI volume**. 

📢 Stay tuned 📢
