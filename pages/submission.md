#### Submission

The submission link is [https://openreview.net/group?id=ifaamas.org/AAMAS/2026/Workshop/CLaRAMAS]().

🆕 CLaRAMAS welcomes 3 kinds of submission:

  - **Full papers**, which must have a **minimum of 10 pages and a maximum of 16** (both excluding references)
  - **Short papers**, which must have **6 pages** (also excluding references)
  - **Posters**, in the form of an extended abstract of at most **3 pages** (guess what? excluding references)

Papers should be written in English,
formatted according to [Springer LNCS guidelines and template](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines),  
and be submitted as a single PDF document on [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=ifaamas.org/AAMAS/2026/Workshop/CLaRAMAS).

**The use of LaTeX is mandatory**.
❌ Excessive use of typesetting tricks to fit into the page limits is not admissible and will result in desk reject.
❌ Modifications to the style files or any of the layout parameters will also result in desk reject.

**All authors are required to have OpenReview profiles**. 
Since these can take some time to obtain, 
please crate them well in advance (1 week before submission). 
*Altering authors after the submission deadline is not allowed.*

🤖 If you have used **generative AI** in the preparation of your paper, 
please read [AAMAS policy](https://cyprusconferences.org/aamas2026/policy-on-ai-assisted-technologies/), that CLaRAMAS adopts, too.

#### Review process

Submitted papers will undergo a 🔎 **double-blind review** process 
involving at least **3 reviewers** per paper. 

Papers will be evaluated upon 
  * **appropriateness** to the workshop's topics
  * **novelty** with respect to the state of the art
  * technical **soundness** of the contribution
  * expected **impact** on the practical engineering of agents and MAS
  * **reproducibility** of experiments (if any)
  * **clarity** of the exposition
  * **positioning** with respect to the state of the art

Check the 📣 [call for papers](/claramas2026/cfp) for the list of relevant topics.

#### Posters 

Posters submitted can describe **both new contributions 
and already published material**. 
In the latter case, 
authors are requested to acknowledge the published material 
explicitly in the extended abstract.

Besides authors' poster submissions, 
reviewers will have the chance to accept a full or short paper as a **poster**, 
️*provided that the authors opted in* during submission of a full or short paper.  
In that case, a **3-pages extended abstract** (excluding references) 
will be required to complement the poster.

🆕 Additionally, authors of accepted full and short papers 
may also request to bring a poster at the workshop, too 🆕: 
in this case, *no additional extended abstract is required*, 
as the poster will be another means of dissemination 
of the accepted paper contribution 
besides the oral presentation. 

❌ Extended abstracts will **NOT be included in CLaRAMAS post-proceedings**, 
but will be made available on CLaRAMAS website publicly.

#### Publication of accepted papers

Accepted papers (both full and short, *not posters*) will be published in CLaRAMAS post-proceedings 
as a [Springer CCIS](https://link.springer.com/series/7899) volume. 

A 2nd, **light review round**  will be set up for the camera-ready version 
to check that reviewers' suggestions have been reasonably incorporated, 
and criticism satisfactorily addressed. 

At least one author of each accepted paper 
will be required to [register for the workshop](https://cyprusconferences.org/aamas2026/registration/) 
by the early registration deadline 
with the intention of presenting the paper *in person* at CLaRAMAS. 
**This is a prerequisite for your paper being included in CLaRAMAS post-proceedings**. 

Remote presentation of accepted papers will be considered 
only in exceptional circumstances and on an individual basis:
[ask to us organisers](mailto:stefano.mariani@unimore.it).

📢 Stay tuned 📢 for additional information regarding the expected timeline and workflow.

Additionally, *all* accepted papers (including extended abtracts), 
along with reviews, will be **publicly available on OpenReview**. 

#### Important dates

Check the 📣 [call for papers](/claramas2026/cfp) for the list of relevant topics, 
and the 🗓️ [important dates](/claramas2026/dates) to not miss the submission deadline 😉

#### On supplementary material

*Supplementary material is permitted for full papers only*,
but ⚠️ beware that *reviewers are not obliged to consider it* ⚠️
(unless it's code and data needed for reproducibility)
and that the main manuscript should be self-contained
and fully clarify the scientific and technical contribution. 🆕

We encourage providing supplementary material containing, e.g., 
missing or more comprehensive versions of proofs, 
detailed information about conducted experiments, 
source code, dataset, 
or anything else that may be helpful in making results reproducible. 

❌ Do not use supplementary material to submit an extended or corrected version of papers: 
the reviewers will consult supplementary material only at their discretion. 
Any information that is essential for understanding or evaluating papers must be included in the papers themselves. 
For example, it is not recommended to relegate most of the proofs of theoretical results to the supplementary material. 

❗ Authors must ensure that supplementary material does not compromise the **anonymity** of submissions. ❗

Supplementary material should be submitted as a single zip file, 
that should not exceed 25MB, 
or included as an appendix in the pdf of the main paper itself. 

⚠️ CLaRAMAS will not publish non-textual supplementary material ⚠️. 
Nevertheless, the readers of published papers should have access to the same information as the reviewers. 
This entails that (suitably revised) supplementary material 
should be made openly available by authors themselves in archival form 
at the time of publication of the paper, 
and that a reference to the supplementary material should be included 
in the camera-ready version of the paper. 
For code or data you may wish to use a service such as [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) or [Github](https://github.com/). 

#### Policies

The AAMAS general policies alo apply to CLaRAMAS, 
hence we encourage authors to check them out [here](https://cyprusconferences.org/aamas2026/submission-instructions/) 
before submission,
and [ask to us organisers](mailto:stefano.mariani@unimore.it) if they have questions.
