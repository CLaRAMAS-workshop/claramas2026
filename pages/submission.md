#### Submission

Papers should be written in English,
🆕 formatted according to [Springer LNCS guidelines and template](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines) 🆕,  
and be submitted as a single PDF document on [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=ifaamas.org/AAMAS/2026/Workshop/CLaRAMAS).

The submission link is [https://openreview.net/group?id=ifaamas.org/AAMAS/2026/Workshop/CLaRAMAS]().

🆕 **Full papers** must have a **minimum of 10 pages and a maximum of 20** (both excluding references), 
whereas **short papers** must have a **minimum of 6 pages and a maximum of 8** (also excluding references).
*Supplementary material is permitted for full papers only*, 
but ⚠️ beware that *reviewers are not obliged to consider it* ⚠️
(unless it's code and data needed for reproducibility) 
and that the main manuscript should be self-contained 
and fully clarify the scientific and technical contribution. 🆕 

❌ Excessive use of typesetting tricks to fit into the page limits is not admissible and will result in desk reject.
❌ Modifications to the style files or any of the layout parameters will also result in desk reject. 
**The use of LaTeX is mandatory**.

**All authors are required to have OpenReview profiles**. 
Since these can take some time to obtain, 
please crate them well in advance (1 week before submission). 
*Altering authors after the submission deadline is not allowed.*

🤖 If you have used **generative AI** in the preparation of your paper, 
please read [AAMAS policy](https://cyprusconferences.org/aamas2026/policy-on-ai-assisted-technologies/), that CLaRAMAS adopts, too.

#### Review process

Submitted papers will undergo a 🔎 **double-blind review** process 
involving at least **3 reviewers** per paper. 

Papers will be evaluated upon 
  * **appropriateness** to the workshop's topics
  * **novelty** with respect to the state of the art
  * technical **soundness** of the contribution
  * expected **impact** on the practical engineering of agents and MAS
  * **reproducibility** of experiments (if any)
  * **clarity** of the exposition
  * **positioning** with respect to the state of the art

Check the 📣 [call for proposals](/claramas2026/cfp) for the list of relevant topics.

🆕 Reviewers will have the chance to accept a paper as a **poster** 🏞️ 
instead of a full or short paper, 
*provided that the authors opted in* during submission.  
In that case, a **3-page extended abstract** (excluding references) 
will be required to complement the poster.
❌ Such extended abstract will **NOT be included in CLaRAMAS post-proceedings**, 
but will be made available on CLaRAMAS website publicly.

#### Publication of accepted papers

🆕 Accepted papers (both full and short, not posters) will be published in CLaRAMAS post-proceedings 
as a [Springer CCIS](https://link.springer.com/series/7899) volume. 🆕 

A 2nd, **light review round**  will be set up for the camera-ready version 
to check that reviewers' suggestions have been reasonably incorporated, 
and criticism satisfactorily addressed. 

📢 Stay tuned 📢 for additional information regarding the expected timeline and workflow.

#### Important dates

Check the 📣 [call for proposals](/claramas2026/cfp) for the list of relevant topics, 
and the 🗓️ [important dates](/claramas2026/dates) to not miss the submission deadline 😉

#### On supplementary material

Authors have the option to accompany submissions with supplementary material. 
We encourage providing supplementary material containing, e.g., 
missing or more comprehensive versions of proofs, 
detailed information about conducted experiments, 
source code, dataset, 
or anything else that may be helpful in making results reproducible. 

❌ Do not use supplementary material to submit an extended or corrected version of papers: 
the reviewers will consult supplementary material only at their discretion. 
Any information that is essential for understanding or evaluating papers must be included in the papers themselves. 
For example, it is not recommended to relegate most of the proofs of theoretical results to the supplementary material. 

❗ Authors must ensure that supplementary material does not compromise the **anonymity** of submissions. ❗

Supplementary material should be submitted as a single zip file, 
that should not exceed 25MB, 
or included as an appendix in the pdf of the main paper itself. 

⚠️ CLaRAMAS will not publish non-textual supplementary material ⚠️. 
Nevertheless, the readers of published papers should have access to the same information as the reviewers. 
This entails that (suitably revised) supplementary material 
should be made openly available by authors themselves in archival form 
at the time of publication of the paper, 
and that a reference to the supplementary material should be included 
in the camera-ready version of the paper. 
For code or data you may wish to use a service such as [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) or [Github](https://github.com/).
